Most of the work on this GameJam project comes from CSCI 2113's Project 1 which includes City.java, PlotterPoint.java, GridPoint.java, Entity.java, Simulator.java, and the movement and action behavior of some entities.
The GUI class is required to run the program and it is advised all of the files are compiled with the command: javac -classpath ".:./Plotter.jar" *.java

The goal of this game is to use as many collectors necessary to clear the plot of trash in a short amount of time.
